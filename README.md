# Bstation anime landing page clone

This project is a front-end clone of the Bstation anime streaming website's landing page. It focuses solely on replicating the visual design and layout of the landing page, without including any of the interactive UX features or backend functionality. The clone was created to practice and showcase front-end development skills, particularly in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
